This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Expo's `Constants.deviceId` within asynchronous functions. The problem arises when attempting to access the device ID before Expo has fully initialized its internal state. This usually results in `null` or `undefined` being returned, causing unexpected behavior. The solution involves ensuring the device information is ready before accessing `Constants.deviceId`.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.
